## STACK

* React
* TypeScript
* Node
* Yarn (npm replacement)
* Visual Studio Code (see Extensions)
* MikroORM
* PostgreSQL
* TypeGraphQL

### NPM / YARN / NPX / NODE / NODEMON
* `yarn dev` - The ts-node package allows you to run your TypeScript code directly without compiling it to JavaScript. Itâ€™s like the node executable but for .ts files.
* * Run in a separate node terminal
* `yarn watch` creates the `dist\` dir when it compiles your typescript into javascript
* * Run in a separate node terminal
* * * `MikroORM` will not delete old migration files from here so you will want to delete the `dist` dir then run `yarn watch` from another node terminal so that a fresh one is created

### MikroORM
* Migrations Cmd via CLI: `npx mikro-orm migration:create` 
  * Creates new migration with current schema dif
* Successful Cmd Output From Node-1 (`yarn dev`): ![Migration-Run1](README_IMGS/MikroORM-MigrationCMD_Success.png)
* Successful Cmd Output From Node-2 (`yarn dev`) ![Migration-Run2](README_IMGS/MikroORM-Successful_CMD-YARN_DEV.png)
* Confirm in PGAdmin4 (`postgresql`) ![Confirm-SQL-Worked](README_IMGS/MikroORM-PostgreSUCCESS-Confirm.png)
* Query Database ![Query-Posts](README_IMGS/MikroORM-Successful_Query.png)

### Express (server) / Apollo-Server-Express / GraphQL / Type-GraphQL
* `yarn add express apollo-server-express graphql type-graphql`
* * express = server (middleware)
* * apollo server express allows to use graphql and create a graphql endpoint very easily and then use type-graphql for our schema - Ben Awad
* `yarn add -D @types/express` -- have to install the types for express, the others just work with typescript OOTB
* Start Server: `yarn dev`
* * Server Output ![Start-Express-Server-via-Yarn-Dev-Cmd](README_IMGS/Express_StartServer_YarnDev.png)

* `GraphQL Playground` @ `localhost:4000/graphql` ![graphql-playground-endpoint](README_IMGS/GraphQL-Playground.png)

* **ERROR: Cannot find module (or something to this effet)**: Look to the import statement of the file it supposedly cannot find and use relative pathing if explicit pathing is being used.  What fixed this issue for me was changing `src\entities\Post` to `..\entities\Post`

* If you have successfully added the new Posts Resolver (as of `56:00`) then you should be able to do the following in your GraphQL playground:
